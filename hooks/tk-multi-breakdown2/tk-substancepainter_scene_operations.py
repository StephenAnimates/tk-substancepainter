    Helper Class to store metadata per update item.
    
    The tk-multi-breakdown2 app requires that the 'node' key in each item dictionary
    be a string, as this is what it displays in the UI list.
    
    However, we need to associate more complex data with each item (like the
    resource URL, usage status, etc.) to perform the update correctly.
    
    This class is a workaround for that limitation. It inherits from `str`, so
    it satisfies the breakdown app's requirement. The string value itself is
    formatted with HTML to create a rich text display in the UI. We then attach
    our custom metadata (`resource`, `in_use`, `nice_name`) as attributes directly
    to the object instance.
    
    This allows us to pass complex data through the breakdown process while still
    presenting a user-friendly string in the UI.

        any templates and try to determine if there is a more recent version
